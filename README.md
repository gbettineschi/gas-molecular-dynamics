# Gas Molecular Dynamics simulation
The program simulates and plots the trajectories of the particles of a 2D gas, considering collisions of particles between each others and with the walls.

The system parameters (number of particles, mass of each particle, mass of the walls, etc) can be easily customized.

## The theory behind
We make some assumptions about collisions; mainly:

-   the collisions are elastic;
-   the particles are approximated as hard spheres;
-   there are no intermolecular forces;
-   the particles are assumed to have no rotational degrees of freedom, i.e. to be monoatomic.

## Credits
The code was written while studying Physics at Bocconi University with Professor Luca Saglietti.
